These is the project we have done in our College

We have uploaded the Research paper that have been published as title -  "Campus Shuttle Tracker & Monitoring System".
Anyone can access the paper from the official website of International Journal for Research in Applied Science & Engineering Technology (IJRASET).
The paper is published in January 2025 as Volume 13 Issue I Jan 2025

We have uploaded the codin files of the project. You need to install node to access it

Also we are building the hardware to connect it to the web application. So one can directly track the Campus Shuttle. 
Also we have added Payment link to the web application to pay the Bus fees online. 
Also the portal shows the necessary information like Bus Driver details, Bus fees, etc.
